Editor and Reviewer comments:

Editor: Are there links for refs. 1,2,3

Reviewer #2: The paper of Stephens et al. presents a C++ library, called SootLib, for modeling soot formation and evolution. Two different methods for solving the soot PBE (Population Balance Equation) are included in the library: the sectional model and the method of moments (MOM), in 4 different versions. The library can be coupled to CFD codes for reacting systems.
The paper is well written and organised. The motivations behind this work are clearly explained and the state-of-the-art about modeling of soot is properly summarised with appropriate references. The library is well presented and described: the most relevant points/elements are discussed and commented. The examples at the end of the paper are useful to better understand the potential use of the SootLib library.
In my opinion the paper is suitable for publication on SoftwareX. I have only a minor comment. I think it is useful to add some words about possible extensions of the model capabilities for external users (is it easy to add new sub-models? what are the possible limitations for extensions? etc.).
