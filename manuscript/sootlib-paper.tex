\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Most commercial combustion processes that produce energy involve turbulent, non-premixed flames, which produce soot. Soot is responsible for a flame's luminosity, generates a large portion of a flame's radiative heat transfer to its surroundings, and contributes to many of the health, safety, and environmental hazards associated with air pollution from combustion systems~\cite{EPA_2009,EPA_2004}. In order to address soot's negative effects and optimize practical combustion processes, scientists and engineers require a better understanding of soot's fundamental structure and behavior in combustion environments.

Because combustion processes are so complex, modeling and simulation cannot be fully separated from studying fundamental chemical processes; instead, we must use incomplete knowledge and imperfect models to investigate both simultaneously. We often rely on experimental data for comparison, and as a result, errors must be distinguished by their source\textemdash experimental, theoretical, or computational\textemdash which further complicates modeling. Turbulent combustion uniquely challenges modelers because it involves tightly coupled equations of multicomponent mass transfer, convective and radiative heat transfer, turbulent fluid dynamics, multi-phase flow, and complex chemical kinetics. These span many orders of magnitude in both their length and time scales. Direct simulation approaches can produce accurate simulation data by resolving the full range of length and time scales, but the computational cost can be prohibitively high, particularly for simulating practical combustion processes of interest to engineers~\cite{Pope_2000,Bernard_2002}. Simulating soot in flames further expands the range of scales that must be considered, adding additional complexity and computational cost to direct simulations.

High computational cost in combustion simulations is often addressed by modeling various aspects of the configuration. In particular, computational models that quantify soot production in simulations can help us study its fundamental behavior and distinguish between various reaction mechanisms and transport models. Reactions involving soot are not purely chemical, but also involve particle aggregation, size distributions, and transport that may or may not affect molecular reactions and heat transfer within a flame. Accurate models and simulations that help us clarify the fundamental processes that control soot formation and transport in flames represent an important step forward in the study of combustion systems~\cite{Frenklach_2002b}.

With SootLib, we provide a convenient, easy-to-use access point for soot property and particle dynamics models that can be interfaced with various simulation approaches for combustion CFD. SootLib is a modular C++ library that can compute various source terms for the reacting Navier Stokes equations. Its modular design makes model parts interchangeable (within limits), allowing users to quickly and easily compare and contrast models. Several [TODO: put a number here] models are fully implemented and validated and use a common interface, allowing researchers convenient access to soot modeling tools suitable for various reacting CFD applications.

\section{Model Descriptions}
\label{s:models}

Soot models can generally be broken down into two interrelated parts: chemistry and particle size distribution (PSD). Soot chemistry models address the chemical reactions involved in soot behavior, while PSD models describe the size distribution of soot particles. Given a specific state and a set of soot chemistry mechanisms, the PSD model predicts the amounts and relative locations of different sized soot particles based on their current distribution, the desired chemical mechanisms, and the thermodynamic state of the surrounding gas. Using a particular set of soot chemistry models does not necessitate using a particular PSD model, and vice versa. SootLib takes advantage of this distinction by allowing users to specify individual models rather than predetermined model sets, giving users more flexibility and model developers more control in soot simulations.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Chemistry}
\label{ss:chemistry}

Soot chemistry is typically divided into four main types: nucleation reactions describe how soot particles form from gaseous precursors and may or may not include the condensation of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); surface growth refers to particle growth by the chemical addition of gaseous species to existing soot particles; oxidation reactions describe soot particle size reduction by chemical reactions, usually with oxygen-based gaseous species; and coagulation defines the rate at which soot particles combine to form new particles (and may or may not include the aggregation of particles into large fractal soot structures). Note that while many coagulation processes are not technically chemical reactions, coagulation models are typically structured so as to be analagous to the strictly chemical steps and are usually categorized as a type of soot chemistry.

A complete soot chemistry model typically provides a mechanism for each of the four major steps, each of which occurs independently but all of which depend heavily on the composition and thermodynamic properties of the surrounding gas. Some models provide all four mechanisms, while later research tends to expand on earlier mechanisms or focus on one type. SootLib collects a range of models from the literature and implements them with a uniform interface, offering model developers a flexible testing method and giving research simulations a consistent framework for parametric simulations. Table~\ref{t:chem_models} summarizes the soot chemistry models implemented in SootLib.
