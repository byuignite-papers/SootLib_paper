@inproceedings{Blanquart_2009c,
 abstract = {In this article, we present a joint multi-variate model for soot formation. In this new formulation, each soot particle is represented as a fractal aggregate that is described by three independent parameters: its total volume (V), total surface area (S), and number of hydrogenated (or active) sites on its surface (H). The moments of the Number Density Function (NDF) of soot particles are solved using the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM). This method allows for an accurate prediction of the moments without the cost of more expensive methods like Monte-Carlo (MC). The source terms for the transport equations include nucleation, coagulation, surface growth, and oxidation. The model relies on a coherent coagulation formulation which treats both the coalescence and the aggregation limits. This model, referred to as Volume-Surface-Hydrogen (VSH), is applied to a series of laminar premixed and diffusion flames. The soot volume fraction and primary particle diameter are predicted with good accuracy when compared to the experimental measurements. Furthermore, by directly solving for the number of active sites on the surface, the model also gives insight into the surface reactivity of soot particles at high temperatures.},

@article{Leung_1991,
 abstract = {The present article outlines a simplified reaction mechanism for the formation, growth, and combustion of soot particles in laminar nonpremixed flames. The model can be combined with detailed chemistry descriptions for the gas phase, as in the present case, or with reduced chemical reaction mechanisms. The reaction mechanism involves nucleation, surface growth, particle coagulation, and combustion steps. The model outlined has been created with the intention of being applicable to the prediction of turbulent flames via different approaches. The soot nucleation and surface growth reactions are linked to the gas phase by presuming that pyrolysis products, in the present case acetylene, and not the fuel itself, are of primary importance in the soot formation process, The deduced reaction mechanism is applied to counterflow ethylene and propane flames burning with a range of oxygen-enriched and -depleted air streams. The results obtained show excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with measured data for soot volume fraction, particle growth, and number density.},

 abstract = {A transported joint probability density function (JPDF) approach closed at the joint scalar level has been applied to investigate two nonpiloted CH4/H2/N2 turbulent (Re  15200 and 22800) jet diffusion flames. The flames have been studied experimentally at the Deutsches Zentrum f{\"u}r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) and at Sandia National Laboratories and are well characterized experimentally through extensive velocity and scalar measurements. The flames offer the opportunity of computational investigations of turbulence--chemistry interactions in CH4/H2 flames in the absence of both partial premixing with air and with a smaller stoichiometric mixture fraction (Zst = 0.167) than in the corresponding piloted Sandia flames. The two flames also offer different levels of local extinction. Comparatively few theoretical studies have been performed of these flames and the present work provides an assessment of the ability of the transported PDF approach to reproduce their detailed thermochemical structure. The chemical closure is obtained through a systematically reduced C/H/O/N mechanism featuring 16 independent, 4 dependent, and 28 steady-state scalars. The velocity field is computed using the second moment closure ofSpeziale et al. and molecular mixing is modeled using the modified Curl's model. It is shown that velocity and scalar fields are generally well reproduced for 10  x/D  80 though uncertainties in boundary conditions have an impact closer to the burner exit.},

 abstract = {The kinetics and mechanisms of soot oxidation were studied at temperatures of 1575 to 1865 K and O2 mole fractions of 10$-$5 to 0.05 in a two-stage atmospheric-pressure combustion system in which soot-laden gas from a primary flame was partially cooled, mixed with oxygen-containing gas, and burned in a downstream premixed flame. The rate of oxidation of soot was measured using light scattering and absorption techniques to determine the particle size and concentration of soot as a function of distance, and hence of time, in the secondary flame. Complementary measurements of soot particle size were performed using probe sampling, electron microscopy, and electrical mobility analysis, and the specific surface area of the soot at different stages of burnout was measured by the BET technique. Temperature and gas composition profiles in the secondary flame were determined using coated thermocouples with electrical compensation for radiation loss, chromatographic analysis of sampled stable gases, and a spectroscopic technique combined with partial equilibrium calculations for radical species. It was found that OH radical is the principal oxidant of soot under these conditions, with O2 being of secondary importance. The average value of the collision efficiency of OH with soot is found to be 0.28 if the optical (equivalent sphere) diameter of the soot aggregates is used in the calculations, or about 0.13 if the diameter of the individual spherical units within the aggregates is used. The actual value of the collision efficiency is expected to be bounded by these two values. The results indicate that soot burnout rates predicted from the Nagle and Strickland-Constable formula, which assumes O2 to be the oxidant, are drastically underestimated under fuel-rich flame conditions owing to the neglect of the OH contribution. Breakup of soot aggregates during burnout was observed under fuel lean conditions.},

@article{Patterson_2007,
 abstract = {New bivariate models for soot particle structure are introduced to qualitatively replicate observed particle shapes and are found to offer quantitative improvements over older single-variable models. Models for the development of particle shape during surface growth and for particle collision diameters are described and implemented along with two models taken from other published work. Using a stochastic approach, bivariate soot particle distributions are calculated for the first time. Distributions calculated for the new models are found to be insensitive to the collision diameter model used for coagulation. The total mass of soot produced in a laminar premixed flame is found to vary by no more than 20{\%} as the model for the geometric effects of chemical reactions on the surface of particles is changed. Histories of individual particles are analyzed and show the limitations of collector particle techniques for predicting the evolution of aggregate shape descriptors.},

@article{Wright_2001,
 abstract = {We extendthe application of moment methods to multivariate suspended particle population problems-those for which size alone is insufficient to specify the state of a particle in the population. Specifically, a bivariate extension of the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) (R. McGraw, Aerosol Sci. Technol. 27, 255 (1997)) is presented for efficiently modeling the dynamics of a population of inorganic nanoparticles undergoing simultaneous coagulation and particle sintering. Continuum regime calculations are presented for the Koch-Friedlander-Tandon-Rosner model, which includes coagulation by Brownian diffusion (evaluated for particle fractal dimensions, D(f), in the range 1.8-3) and simultaneous sintering of the resulting aggregates (P. Tandon and D. E. Rosner, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 213, 273 (1999)). For evaluation purposes, and to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the bivariate QMOM, benchmark calculations are carried out using a high-resolution discrete method to evolve the particle distribution function n(nu, a) for short to intermediate times (where nu and a are particle volume and surface area, respectively). Time evolution of a selected set of 36 low-order mixed moments is obtained by integration of the full bivariate distribution and compared with the corresponding moments obtained directly using two different extensions of the QMOM. With the more extensive treatment, errors of less than 1{\%} are obtained over substantial aerosol evolution, while requiring only a few minutes (rather than days) of CPU time. Longer time QMOM simulations lend support to the earlier finding of a self-preserving limit for the dimensionless joint (nu, a) particle distribution function under simultaneous coagulation and sintering (Tandon and Rosner, 1999; D. E. Rosner and S. Yu, AIChE J., 47 (2001)). We demonstrate that, even in the bivariate case, it is possible to use the QMOM to rapidly model the approach to asymptotic behavior, allowing an immediate assessment of when previously established asymptotic results can be applied to dynamical situations of current/future interest.
